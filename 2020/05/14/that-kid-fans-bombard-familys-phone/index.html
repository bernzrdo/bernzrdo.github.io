            <h1>That Kid fans bombard family's phone</h1>
            <p><b>Thousands of music fans have been bombarding an Oldham family with calls - ever since their telephone number featured on a pop track.</b></p>

            <img id="albumart" src="https://is3-ssl.mzstatic.com/image/thumb/Music123/v4/3b/fd/86/3bfd867c-670a-fc67-5534-7c7ae58de361/source/1200x1200bb.jpg">
            <p>US pop artist That Kid included the ex-directory number in his latest hit, Kiss Me Thru The Phone.</p>
            <p>Since it's release, Gerry Matley and his wife Catriona Howard Smith have been getting about 60 calls a day from fans hoping to talk to the 21-year-old star.</p>
            <p>They said some of them even sing the song down the phone.</p>
            <p>"We just tell them that he doesn't live in Oldham," 52-year-old Ms Howard Smith said.</p>
            <p>"They have asked if I am his boyfriend but I think I am a bit too old and straight, even for That Kid.</p>
            <p>"Some of them really want to believe that they have got through to their heart-throb.</p>
            <p>"They insist that we must know him in some way, we have to be 'special' to him.</p>
            <p>"Some of them are devastated when we have to tell them that he doesn't live in Oldham but over the other side of the Atlantic."</p>
            <p>The couple's number, which is the beginning of the 12-digit number that appears in the chorus, is on at least 300,000 websites.</p>
            <p>The calls have been going on for over a month, some in the early hours of the morning.</p>
            <p>Mr Matley, 54, said: "I mean, with my looks and my accent, I fit the perfect profile for a pop artist from Oldham.</p>
            <p>"What's the chances of our phone number appearing in a US pop song? Probably as likely as winning the lottery, but without the money."</p>
            <p>Ms Howard Smith added: "If they called the number with the American dialling code in front of it they will get through to a recorded message from him.</p>
            <p>"We just hope the fuss will die down soon - we can't even change our number because Gerry needs it for work."</p>
            <p>Kiss Me Thru The Phone reached a high position of number one on the UK Singles Chart after its release last month.</p>
